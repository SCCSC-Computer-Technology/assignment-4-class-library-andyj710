I did not have any issues loading up the project file and viewing the code.
I saw that the dbml file is there and correctly set up with appropriate data types and column names.
I also used the Linq to SQL statements for my queries.
The method names are named somewhat nondescriptively, but there are good comments throughout.
I could easily tell what everything is supposed to do.
